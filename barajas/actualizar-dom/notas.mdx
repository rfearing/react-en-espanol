<Note>

<p>
	When you visit a website, your browser displays HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

- HTML provides structure and content,
- CSS provides styles
- and lastly JavaScript provides interactivity.

<p>
	In order to make changes to webpages, Javascript needs a little help.
	Luckily, all modern browsers provide Javascript with this necessary help via Web APIs.</p>

<p>
	Web APIs are a set of tools that allow Javascript to interact with the browser and the user.</p>

<p>
	The Web API to manipulate the HTML DOM is called the "HTML DOM API."</p>

<p>
	Some other Web APIs include the Fetch API, to make network connections and the URL API to structure and parse URLs.</p>
